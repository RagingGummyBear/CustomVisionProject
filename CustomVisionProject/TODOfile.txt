// I. Use a better classification and then use color contours to findout the coffee in the image

// II. Skip the part of using better classification and user color contours to findout the coffee in the image

// III. Try to make the Object detection work

-- Get reference images ( these will be used to guess the outcome of the user's coffee )

// For coffee characteristics use:
// 1. Histogram compare on the cropped part with some other cropped parts
// 2. Intensity of the colors of a histogram
// 3. Try back propagation
// 4. Use color contours to get a shape maybe?
// 5. Try to use feature extraction
